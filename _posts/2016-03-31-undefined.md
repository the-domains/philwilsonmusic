I've finally found the sound behind the drums I've been looking for. Ludwig Drums. I'm currently using a Ludwig Classic Maple, 26" kick, 14" rack and a 16" floor. Matched with Istanbul Agop Cymbals and a 14" Brady is the sound I've always wanted and found. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/45307396-ba35-4395-ae5a-6a94549b377a.jpg)
